# Cat and Dog Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented in Keras. CNNs are particularly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features directly from pixel data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs. Each image is labeled as either a cat or a dog. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 61.86% on the testing dataset.
